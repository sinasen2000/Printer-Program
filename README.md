# Printer-Program
It is a program written in Java that I tested my object oriented programming knowledge. The program consists of abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance and reading&amp;writing text files. It reads an existing file of a printer catalogue, then lets the user to add new printers to the catalogue, sort the printers by type or brand, etc.
